# Funeral Services Bureau

Initially, the website was considered as an educational project about AngularJS. 
Then (*almost unchanged*) it was implemented as a commercial project
for the local funeral services bureau, where it has been successfully
functioned as a business website for four years.

## Installtion

Just copy of the source stuff to the catalog on the webserver. No other settings is needed.

**P.S.**

This project was written mainly with only purpose to test the knowledge I'm gained during my
learning of Angular JS.
