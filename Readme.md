# Funeral Services Bureau

Initially, the website was considered as an educational project,
then (almost unchanged) it was implemented as a commercial project
for the local funeral services bureau, where it has been successfully
functioned as a business website for four years.

**P.S.**

This project was written as testing the knowledge I gained during my
learning of Angular JS
