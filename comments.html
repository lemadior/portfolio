                                The site is very simple. However, all elements, including the slider, 
                                are made from scratch by me. Its main task is to give a general idea 
                                of my capabilities in terms of layout and provide samples of other 
                                my works in the field of web-development.
                            </p>

                            <h3>About Menu</h3>
                            <p>
                                As for the menu, its absence is due, in fact, to the lack of positions 
                                (logical sections) in the site structure. Once again, it's just a 
                                portfolio (or business card) site.
                            </p>

                            <h3>About Layout</h3>
                            <p>
                                The site has a responsive layout, so it can be viewed quite comfortably 
                                on a phone or tablet.
                            </p>

                            <h3>About Contacts</h3>
                            <p>
                                There are no contacts due to the fact that I plan to give a link to 
                                this resource to those who already have my contacts anyway. The problem 
                                is not to create a feedback form - it's just not difficult. For those 
                                who could write to me I will give my data anyway, but "pleasing" the 
                                bots is not at all part of my plans.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>
                                Therefore be so!
