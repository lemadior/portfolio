                        <p>
                            The site is very simple. However, all elements, including the slider,
                            are made from scratch by me. Its main task is to give a general idea
                            of my capabilities in terms of layout and provide samples of other
                            my works in the field of web-development.
                        </p>

                        <h3>About Menu</h3>
                        <p>
                            As for the menu, its absence is due, in fact, to the lack of positions
                            (logical sections) in the site structure. Once again, it's just a
                            portfolio (or business card) site.
                        </p>

                        <h3>About Layout</h3>
                        <p>
                            The site has a responsive layout, so it can be viewed quite comfortably
                            on a phone or tablet.
                        </p>

                        <h3>About Contacts</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are no contacts due to the fact that I plan to give a link to
                            this resource to those who already have my contacts anyway. The problem
                            is not to create a feedback form - it's just not difficult. For those
                            who could write to me, I will give my data anyway, but "pleasing" the
                            bots is not at all part of my plans.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, be so!
